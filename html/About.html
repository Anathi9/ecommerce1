        Our Story
        We then realised we all eat what is most convenient and this was not always the healthiest choice, so we decided to take a different road in June 2017. We then decided to help people become more food conscious of what they were eating, for a more healthier and more prosperous future. Knowing our health is our wealth.
        
        This change did not come without its own costs losing almost all of our current clientele at the time when making the shift, but we knew it had to be done. You do ask yourself the question after losing 90% of your revenue for two months if you have made the right move.
        
        As a healthy food provider, we are happy to have helped thousands of people get their weight and health back on track by eating well portioned and healthy meals. It is a lifestyle we now live and preach to our clients, family, and friends every day.
        
        At the end of the day it is all about your lifestyle choices.
        
        The FIT Food 4U brand strives for quality and consistency. We have a loving and passionate team ensuring we give you the best quality possible.
        
        We ensure you live a happy and healthy lifestyle all with the convenience of us delivering to your doorstep, offering you a great experience every time you order from start to finish. Part of our vision is a better U.</p>
